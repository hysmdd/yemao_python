It's been a long time since the show, and it's really sad to see Arthur in love today. When I watched the show, I thought the End of the Universe CP was a perfect match. But regardless of the real people, looking at the characters, really like the princess. She is noble and beautiful, even if Li Xun hurt her again and again, she will still choose to forgive him, again and again standing beside Li Xun again, regardless of the opposition of all the people around. She said that the betrayers went to hell, and that she was always the most loyal guardian of the king."She volunteered to be the patron saint of the lonely king, spending all her life and offering gentleness. She always stood with him, forge ahead together, pain together, together deep in the mire, or expand the territory."Instead of saying," I like you, "she said," You choose me, I will never betray you."In front of the king, the princess put down all the pride, willing to be the king's most loyal warrior. This is how a paragraph of unforgettable love. The scene of the most burning in the whole play I think is Li Xun rushed on stage for his sister to beat blind the enemy at that moment and the anger of hearing the betrayal of the most trusted brother in prison. Although he is very poor, but he hurt the princess again and again, really hate. His early humiliation of the two men was also very annoying. The show has four stars for the princess.
